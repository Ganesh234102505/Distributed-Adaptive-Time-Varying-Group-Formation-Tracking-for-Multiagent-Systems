# Distributed Control Systems - Multi-Agent System Coordination

## Overview

This project implements a cooperative control law on a group of two-input-two-output double integrator systems, which represent the feedback-linearized version of a two-wheeled mobile robot with non-holonomic constraints. The objective is to achieve group formation tracking as specified by the formation reference vector `r` and formation configuration vector `h`.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to apply the cooperative control law on a group of multi-agent systems to achieve coordination and formation tracking. Specifically, the control law is designed to handle a system with multiple leaders and followers, each with a time-varying formation configuration.

## Project Structure

1. **Theory**
   - Explanation of the cooperative control law used to achieve group formation tracking.
   - The control law involves parameters such as coupling weight, group formation tracking error, and optimal controller parameters computed using the Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE).

2. **MATLAB Code**
   - MATLAB scripts are provided for implementing the control law. The steps include:
     - Setting up the state-space representation of the system.
     - Calculating the Laplacian matrix for the graph representing the agents.
     - Solving the Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) to compute the optimal controller parameters.
     - Implementing the control law to compute the time-varying coupling gain (`ci`) and the group formation tracking error (`ρi`).
     - Building the control system in Simulink.

3. **Simulation in Simulink**
   - The project includes a detailed Simulink model that simulates the system’s behavior under the cooperative control law.
   - The model tracks the displacement and velocity of each agent in the system.
   - Separate subsystems are created to manage the calculation of `ci` and `ρi` for each agent.

4. **Results**
   - The simulation results demonstrate how the system achieves consensus under different formation configurations.
   - For specific configurations of the formation vector `h`, the agents either maintain zero displacement and velocity or reach a consensus from non-zero initial conditions.

5. **Conclusion**
   - The project successfully demonstrates that the system can achieve consensus depending on the formation configuration vector.
   - The results validate the effectiveness of the cooperative control law in managing multi-agent system coordination.

## How to Use

### 1. Prerequisites
   - MATLAB with Simulink installed on your system.
   - Basic knowledge of state-space representation, control systems, and MATLAB/Simulink.

### 2. Running the MATLAB Code
   - Open the provided MATLAB scripts and run them to set up the state-space representation and compute the necessary control parameters.
   - The scripts include functions to solve the Algebraic Riccati Equation and calculate the coupling gain and formation tracking error.

### 3. Simulating in Simulink
   - Open the Simulink model provided in the project.
   - Run the simulation with the specified formation vector `h` to observe the behavior of the agents.
   - Modify the formation vector `h` to see how different configurations affect the system’s consensus.

### 4. Interpreting Results
   - Analyze the displacement and velocity tracking graphs generated by the simulation.
   - Use these graphs to determine whether the system has achieved consensus and how it responds to different initial conditions.
